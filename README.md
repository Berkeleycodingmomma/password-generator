## Description 
I created an application that a user can use to generate a strong random secure password based on the four promts they were given in selecting the criteria. It features HTML, CSS, and is powered by my JavaScript code. It adapts to multiple screen sizes.

(ABOVE)- I learned alot about creating arrays (which are a sequence of values). They are a visual representation of repeated addition or multiplication. I learned how to declare a variable with an array type and then create the array itself. 




(ABOVE)- DOM Event Listners, after studing I learned that they "listen" for and action, then calls a function that performs a related task. In this example of code that is placed above, it is attaching an event handler to the specified element without overiding exsiting event handlers.
